Your goal, as Decoder, is to crack the secret Code provided by CodeMaster, with the least number of attempts.

The Code can be made up of any combination of the four numbers.
The MasterCode can use two or more equal numbers, in different positions.

You have to duplicate the exact numbers and positions of the hidden Code.

After every guess, the CodeMaster must inform the Decoder of their progress using the following symbols:
(+) Corresponds a correct number in the correct position.
(-) Corresponds a correct number, but in the wrong position.
( ) Wrong number.

The game ends when the Decoder guesses the secret Code.
